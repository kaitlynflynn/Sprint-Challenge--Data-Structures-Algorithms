Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
`O(log n)` or `O(n)`

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
`O(n)`

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
`O(log n)` or `O(n)`

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 
`O(log n)` or `O(n)`

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
`O(n log n)` or `O(n)`

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

Leaning towards `O(log n)`, but that's a guess
